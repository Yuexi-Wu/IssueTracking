# IssueTracking -- Course project for CS6083, Spring 2020  
This is a web-based issue tracking system similar to Jira -- but kind of different and much simpler.  
It allows members to create projects, report issues/bugs for projects, assign the issue to certain people for fixing, and change the status of issues in the workflow.
